## Toggle modal class

This is a project ib which I'm making a incursion on JavaScript classes and reusable code.

I coded a class that turn open and close a modal esier and faster.

## How to use it

### (1) create the modal div, open and close buttons (HTML basic structure)

### (2) css basic styling for modal position, i.e., position = absolute; width = 100vw, height = 100vh; left = 0; top = -100vh (hide modal on top direction )

### (3) the elements created at step (1) are selected by their css class or id (it must be passed as a argument when creatiang new Class, i.e., new ToggleModal('#modal', '.open-btn', '#close-btn))

### (4) create new ToggleModal and set start point for sliding action, i.e, newModal.start = 'top';

### (5) if all is done in the right way, just enjoy your modal appering on screen!

### (6) feel free to clone it and have fun!
